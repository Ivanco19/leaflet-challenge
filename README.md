# leaflet-challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day. For this project I used all the earthquakes information from the last 7 days. You can find this info in the following link: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

To visualize this big amount of data I used leaflet. You can find in this map the following earthquake information: Magnitude, Location and Depth. There are a lot of different sizes and colors in this visualization. Here the meanings:

Circle size : Reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size (Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger)
Color: According to the earthquake depth (earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.)

Enjoy!
